# smartprocurement
A simple blockchain project.
It was created out of pure curiosity to find what blockchain technology can do. Yes it can do wonders if u write the right Solidity contract and the rigth JS code to access
The above code is for the Smart tracking of Packages. Not a completely developed product.
Currently its just to test the blockchain and nothing much
The solidity code can be used/modified to create ur own simple blockchain database
